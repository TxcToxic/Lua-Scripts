# Note:
You have to turn it in the lua to `true`
# Info:
* both luas will crash silent
* `client.lua` (if enabled) will crash the user on join (the user won't see it!)
* `server.lua` (if enabled) will crash the server on resource join
# Other:
* Please don't use it to grief, if you do not my blame :P
* Use it to protect your scripts or anything, not illegal shit!
